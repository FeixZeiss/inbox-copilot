# inbox-copilot 

**inbox-copilot** is a local Python tool that analyzes, classifies, and processes your Gmail inbox  
(e.g. job applications, newsletters, security alerts).

The project uses the **Gmail API**, a **rule-based engine**, and a **persistent state** to process emails efficiently and reproducibly.

---

## Features

- OAuth2 authentication with the Gmail API
- Read Gmail messages (metadata / full)
- Rule-based classification system (applications, newsletters, security alerts, etc.)
- Persistent state (last processed timestamp)
- Optional: interview draft creation from JSON logs
- Clean project architecture (CLI scripts, core logic, storage)
- Designed for local execution with Conda or virtual environments

## Requirements
- Linux or WSL
- Python 3.10+
- Google Account with GMailAPI enabled
- Conda or virtualenv

## Gmail API Setup
1. Create a Google Cloud project
2. Enable the Gmail API
3. Create an OAuth client (Desktop application)
4. Download credentials.json
5. Place the file here:
```bash
inbox-copilot/secrets/credentials.json
```

⚠️ Never commit credentials.json or gmail_token.json

## OpenAI / ChatGPT API Setup (optional)
If you use features that call OpenAI (e.g. application analysis), you need an API key.
1. Create an API key in your OpenAI account
2. Run `make setup` to create a local .env file in the project root
3. Edit the .env file:

Create/edit:
```bash
nano .env
```

Add:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE"
```

Notes:
- Keep the quotes if your shell/editor adds special characters.
- Never commit .env (should be in .gitignore).
Edit `.env` before your first run.

## Installation
Conda environment (recommended)
```bash
conda create -n inbox-copilot python=3.11
conda activate inbox-copilot
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or use the Makefile:
```bash
make setup
```
## ▶️ Running the Project
```bash
python scripts/run_once.py
```
Or with Make:
```bash
make run
```
`make run` will source `setup.sh` automatically.

On the first run:
- A browser window opens for OAuth login
- Gmail access must be granted
- gmail_token.json is created automatically

## 🔁 Repeated Runs
- OAuth token is reused automatically
- Processing state is persisted
- Deleted or unavailable messages are skipped safely

## ✉️ Create Drafts from Interview Logs
Interview analyses are stored as JSON in `logs/interviews`. You can turn them into Gmail drafts:

```bash
python scripts/create_drafts_from_interviews.py --dry-run
```

Only files with `action_required: true` are used. The script creates a marker file
`*.draft.json` next to the source JSON to avoid duplicates.

Optional: generate "perfect" drafts via OpenAI:
```bash
python scripts/create_drafts_from_interviews.py --use-openai --dry-run
```

Useful flags:
- `--default-to "recruiter@example.com"` set a default recipient
- `--no-skip-existing` ignore marker files and create drafts again
- `--model`, `--language`, `--tone` adjust OpenAI output

## 🧯 Troubleshooting
❌ invalid_grant: Token has been expired or revoked
```bash
rm secrets/gmail_token.json
python scripts/run_once.py
```
➡️ Re-run OAuth authentication

❌ HttpError 404: Requested entity was not found
- The email was deleted or moved
- The error is handled and the message is skipped
- If you suspect state issues, delete `.state/state.json` to force a bootstrap run

## Security
- Secrets are stored locally only
- No cloud backend besides Gmail API
- Tokens can be revoked at any time in Google Account settings

## Future Ideas
- IMAP fallback
- LLM-assisted classification
- Web dashboard

## 🧠 Philosophy
- Inbox Zero — but with control.
- Automation without black boxes. Rules over magic.
